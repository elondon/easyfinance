# todo implement blueprints
# todo finish login system
# todo come up with a better way to handle database/sessions. There has to be a better way with SQLAlchemy! database.py is pretty silly.
# todo model validation
# todo environments, config files, etc...
# todo security, permissions, etc...
# todo one to many relationship for user -> entities
# todo should probably hash the entity names so people looking at the DB can't tie numbers back to a specific entity. Obfuscation.
# todo convert timestamps to unix time stamps. donkey for not doing this to begin with.
